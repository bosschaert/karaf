\u001B[1mDESCRIPTION\u001B[0m
    This bundle provides JMX classes loaded during Karaf boot process.

    In particular it provides the KarafMBeanServerBuilder.

    The KarafMBeanServerBuilder builds a special MBeanServer that allows role-based authorization 
    for JMX access.
    This class must be loadable from modules, so it has to be either in a fragment bundle attached to the
    system bundle or be made available through the boot delegation class path.
